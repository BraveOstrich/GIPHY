# GIPHY

The GIPHY assigment was to get more familiar with APIs and ajax.

When the page loads, you will see five preseelcted GIF categories. You can click on the button to load 10 GIFs from that topic, or you can enter a topic of your own in the form box to retrieve your own category.

When the GIFs load you will see they are still images, click an image to start the GIF animation.
